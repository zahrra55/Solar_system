# Solar System ðŸŒŒ

A computer graphics project developed as part of the University of Baghdad's computer science course, showcasing a simplified model of our solar system using **OpenTK**.

---

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Interactive Animation:** Watch planets orbiting the sun in a realistic manner.
- **Customizable Experience:** Adjust parameters like planet sizes, speeds, or orbit distances.
- **Educational:** Learn about using OpenTK for graphics rendering and C# for building graphical applications.

---

## ðŸ“– Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to use **OpenTK (Open Toolkit)**, a C# wrapper for OpenGL, to create animations and visualizations. The solar system includes:

1. A central sun.
2. Multiple planets with their unique orbital paths.
3. Adjustable parameters for learning and experimentation.

---

## ðŸš€ Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Visual Studio** (latest version recommended)
- **.NET Framework** (if not already installed)
- **OpenTK NuGet Package**
  - Open the project in Visual Studio and run the following command in the NuGet Package Manager Console:

    ```bash
    Install-Package OpenTK
    ```
---

## ðŸ–¥ Usage

Run the Program: Launch the application to see the planets orbiting the sun.
Experiment with Code:
  Modify the Program.cs file to adjust parameters like:
  - Planet sizes.
  - Orbital speeds.
  - Distances from the sun.
  Add new planets or customize their colors.

### Notes:
  - Ensure that the OpenTK package is installed properly; otherwise, the rendering may not work.
  - If you encounter errors related to dependencies, try cleaning the project (Build > Clean Solution) and rebuilding it.
